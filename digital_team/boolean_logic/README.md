    Introduction to Boolean Logic
</h1>
<p>
    In this folder, you will be getting an introduction to boolean logic and how we can represent it with digital
    circuits. The goal is to give you a fundamental understanding of boolean logic, how we represent these
    abstractions, and why they are useful.

<p>
    Just to preface, it would help to understand the basics of <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computers-and-internet/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:digital-information/xcae6f4a7ff015e7d:binary-numbers/v/the-binary-number-system"> binary </a> and <a href=""> transistor theory </a>. You can read up on it if you'd like, but we will go over it briefly here. If you want a full introduction to a lot of basic concepts, consider taking ENGR 40M!

<h2>
    Binary
</h2>
<p>
    Binary logic is a fundamental concept in digital electronics, and it revolves around the use of two distinct states, 0 and 1. A binary 0 represents an "off" state whereas a 1 represents an "on" state. The reason we use two distinct states it matches the physical characteristics of electronic components, is scalable, and has robust operation even with the presense of noise.
